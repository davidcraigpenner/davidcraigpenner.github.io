	abstract = {Fe-Cr model alloys (with 20-80 wt.\% Cr) were exposed to a CH4-H2 mixture in a microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) atmosphere. Severe metal dusting and carburization are observed on the low-Cr alloys, meanwhile, diamond cannot nucleate until a graphite intermediate layer has formed on the substrate, which takes a long incubation time. Increasing Cr concentrations in the Fe-Cr alloys promotes the formation of a Cr carbide buffer layer, which inhibits metal dusting and the formation of graphite interlayer. Consequently, diamond nucleation and growth are greatly enhanced, and continuous diamond films with enhanced adhesion are deposited on the Fe-80Cr alloys.}

	abstract = {The summation-by-parts (SBP) property can be used to construct high-order provably stable numerical methods. A general framework is explored for deriving provably stable and conservative artificial dissipation operators for use with high-order traditional and element-type SBP operators on general nodal distributions, thus enabling the time stable and accurate solution of practical nonlinear problems, including those problems that contain variable coefficients, for example, aerodynamics problems involving the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The basic premise is presented for scalar conservation laws and then extended to entropy stability for systems. Artificial dissipation operators for use with traditional SBP operators are constructed having 1\textsuperscript{st}, 3\textsuperscript{rd}, 5\textsuperscript{th}, and 7\textsuperscript{th} order accuracy on the interior achieved with minimum-width stencils that have ample flexibility in the derivation of novel accuracy-preserving boundary closures. Element-type dissipation operators are constructed on the Legendre-Gauss and Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodal distributions. The stability and accuracy properties of a suite of the constructed artificial dissipation operators are characterized in the numerical solution of the quasi-one-dimensional Euler equations applied to a converging-diverging nozzle.}

	abstract = {We investigate coordinate transformations, quadrature accuracy, and functional superconvergence for diagonal-norm tensor-product generalized summation-by-parts operators. We show that projection operators of degree $r \geq 2p$ are required to preserve quadrature accuracy, and therefore functional superconvergence, in curvilinear coordinates when: (1) the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation is approximated by the same generalized summation-by-parts operator that is used to approximate the flux terms and (2) the degree of the generalized summation-by-parts operator is lower than the degree of the polynomial used to represent the geometry of interest. Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto and Legendre-Gauss element-type operators are considered. When the aforementioned condition (2) is violated for the Legendre-Gauss operators, there is an even-odd quadrature convergence pattern that is explained by the cancellation of the leading truncation error terms for the projection operators that correspond to the odd-degree Legendre-Gauss operators.}
