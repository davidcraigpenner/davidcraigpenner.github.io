David is a doctoral researcher in Aerospace Engineering who is interested in the development of novel numerical methods for scientific applications and engineering. His doctoral work is focused on the development of a high-order flow solver using the generalized summation-by-parts framework for the efficent numerical solution of partial differential equations over complex geometries. Applications include computational fluid dynamics and aerodynamic shape optimization.

David received a BSc degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Saskatchewan and is currently a member of the of the [Computational Aerodynamics Laboratory](http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/research/computational-aerodynamics/){:target="\_blank"} at the [University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies](http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/home/){:target="\_blank"} and is advised by [Professor David W. Zingg](http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/~dwz/){:target="\_blank"}.
