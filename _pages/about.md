David is a PhD Candidate in Aerospace Engineering who is interested in the development of novel numerical methods for scientific and engineering applications. His doctoral work is focused on investigating, and potentially improving, the properties of high-order generalized summation-by-parts operators and methods in the context of problems of increasing practical relevance, for example, fluid flow problems governed by the steady and unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Applications include computational fluid dynamics and aerodynamic shape optimization.

David received a BSc degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Saskatchewan. He is currently a member of the [Computational Aerodynamics Laboratory](http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/research/computational-aerodynamics/){:target="\_blank"} at the [University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies](http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/){:target="\_blank"} and is advised by [Professor David W. Zingg](http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/~dwz/){:target="\_blank"}.
